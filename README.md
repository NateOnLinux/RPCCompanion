# WIP: RPCCompanion
 
 Expect bugs.
 
 This is a plugin for [StreamCompanion](https://github.com/Piotrekol/StreamCompanion) which provides detailed Rich Presence information to Discord.
 Currently two modes are supported: "Detailed" and "Minimal"
 
## Want to try it out? 
 
 1. Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/NateOnLinux/rpcCompanion/releases) page and download the latest version.
 2. Unpack the archive (.zip)
 3. Copy everything to `C:\Program Files (x86)\StreamCompanion\Plugins` (Copy the whole Dlls folder - do not remove the file inside)
 4. Start StreamCompanion
 5. Open StreamCompanion Settings and then Discord Rich Presence

 6. Select whether you'd like Detailed or Minimal mode. If using Detailed mode, it's recommended to enter your profile link in the text box (Your profile will be detected automatically in future releases)
 7. Disable "Discord Rich Presence" in osu! settings if it's enabled
 8. Check "Enable RPC Companion"
 
 Please submit bugs and feature requests [here](https://github.com/NateOnLinux/rpcCompanion/issues).
 
 #Linux Support:
 Currently Linux and MacOS are not supported (StreamCompanion does not support Linux/MacOS). A lot of the code in this project is linux-friendly, so I plan to make a CLI app with similar functionality in the future.
